## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This was my first time using Tailwind css, so I learned a lot about it.
I am not so familiar with styling in CSS, so I think, that this challenge helped me improve in this aspect.
One of the most challenging part was figuring out how I can format a part of a wrapping line, and even adding conditionally a red dot at the end.
I am not sure if my solution is the go-to way, but it works.

### Continued development

In the future I would like to create more complex sites, with more states and more dynamism.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind css documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - This is my first time using Tailwind, so I needed the documentation a lot.
